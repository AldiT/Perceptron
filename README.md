# Perceptron

This project (or just this piece of code) is my effort to learning artificial intelligence techniques. I am making a research for my 
Bachelor Thesis and I am lovin it , Math, Science , Programming and Deep Thinking all in one, I mean ,is this heaven?
Anyway for anyone that might happen' to check this , this are pieces of code mostly from a book about AI, if you guys got a piece of
advice, a critic or a question please please let me know. Any contribution to this project would be very much appreciated.
